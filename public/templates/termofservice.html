                                  Some areas of the Service may allow Users to post feedback, comments, questions, polls, projects, tasks, data, and other information (“User Content”). You are solely responsible for your User Content that you upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make available (referred to in this agreement as “message”) on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. 360notion will not review, edit, share, distribute, or reference any such User Content except as provided in this agreement or in our Privacy Policy. All such User Content is owned by the User who posted it to the Service, although each User acknowledges and consents that upon the introduction of an User invite designated by the Corporate Network or Conglomerate Network into that User’s network, all related User Content will automatically become the property of the company or conglomerate to which the Network belongs without any notice to Users of that Network.</p>
                                     <p>   If a Corporate Network or Conglomerate Network has an Administrator, all such User Content is the property of the company to which the Network belongs (including all User Content posted within a Network and all User Content created prior to the existence of the Administrator). In either case, 360notion does not have, nor does it claim, any ownership rights in any User Content. Each User grants 360notion a fully transferable royalty free license to publish such Content. In addition, you should note that if you are no longer an eligible member of a network (e.g., you cease to be employed by the relevant company), your access to all User Content you uploaded may be terminated. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company, which administers that Network, and the royalty free license shall then remain in effect in perpetuity. </br>
<br>By utilizing the Service, you agree to have the domain portion of your email address (“@yourcorp.com”) and/or the company, school, or organization name represented by such domain portion of your email address, and/or the organization name listed on the 360notion website in a company directory listing (“Directory”). Customers (as defined below) who do not want to be included in such published Directory may send a written request to admin@myabuy.com to remove their company, school, or organization name from the Directory.</br> 

<br>You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (iv) contains any information or content that is unlawful, hateful, intolerant, threatening, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, or otherwise objectionable; (v) contains any information or content that is illegal; (vi) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (vii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current.<br></br> You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below), rights of publicity and privacy. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization. 
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction. <br></br>
360notion takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the Service, is solely your responsibility.<br></br> 360notion is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Content. You understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, invasive, indecent, obscene or objectionable, and you agree that 360notion shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of such User Content. 
You are solely responsible for your interactions with other 360notion Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. 
You are required to inform 360notion.com promptly of any changes to your account or contact information and are solely responsible to do so. We are not liable for any misdirected messages or broadcasts should you fail to provide 360notion.com with timely, updated, wholly accurate contact information.

                                     Each Company Network may have one or more individuals who are responsible for overseeing the use of, and monitoring the content posted to, such Network (the “Administrator”). Networks may exist on the Service absent an Administrator; in such case Users are responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this Agreement.  <br></br> 
From time to time, Users may be asked to confirm their account on the Network via an email message containing a hyperlink to the User’s Network email address. If such account is not reconfirmed, the account is removed. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company, which administers that Network.  <br></br> 
Users should follow their particular company’s policies, guidelines, and procedures concerning the Content they post to the Service. Users may delete their own User Content from the Network, so long as they are a Member of that Network.

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, excluding that body of laws known as choice of law or conflict of laws. Subject to the provisions of this Section, all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration conducted in Washington, DC, before J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE or its successor ("JAMS") pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. (the "Act"); and (iii) this Agreement.

The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with each other in promptly selecting a single arbitrator from JAMS's panel of neutrals.

Judgment on the arbitrator's award will be final and binding upon the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If for any reason JAMS or its successor no longer is in business, then the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's fees will be shared equally by the parties and each party will initially bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, but the prevailing party shall be reimbursed by the other party for all attorneys’ fees, witness fees, and arbitration costs. All papers, documents, or evidence, whether written or oral, filed with or presented in connection with the arbitration proceeding will be deemed by the parties and by the arbitrator to be confidential information of both parties. The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from applying for and obtaining from a court a temporary restraining order and/or other injunctive relief.
